# Kaggle_M5_Accuracy
My first competition in kaggle, resulted in top 34%

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is one of the two complementary competitions that together comprise the M5 forecasting challenge. It is to estimate, as precisely as possible, the point forecasts of the unit sales of various products sold in the USA by Walmart. (link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy) I used 5 days to do this project and finished at 1855/5558 (top 33%), I learned a lot from this competition (especially the time is very necessary ! ), and feel fulfilled with my outcomes. I think I can do better job next time.

How I did th prediction:
* I read some samples of the data, understanding its structure and valid information;
* I ploted figures for the data and selected the related ones for modelling;
* I separate the time period, prices (this part I don't have time to finish), and the locations.
* And I planed to do models for evaluation and validation, respectively, but I got busy during the competition ~

My results were luckily fine, it gives me confidence for the future of data science career ! I believe I can do that better next time !
